# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains Python code files for various machine learning assignments. Each notebook focuses on a specific machine learning task, utilizing libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and plotly.

## Notebooks:

1. [ML_assignment_2_fraud_detection.ipynb](ML_assignment_2_fraud_detection.ipynb) - Implements a fraud detection model using RandomForest and DecisionTree classifiers.

2. [ML_assignment_2_target_marketing.ipynb](ML_assignment_2_target_marketing.ipynb) - Applies machine learning for target marketing using GradientBoostingClassifier.

3. [ML_assignment_3_Homesite_Quote_Conversion.ipynb](ML_assignment_3_Homesite_Quote_Conversion.ipynb) - Creates a model for Homesite Quote Conversion with the use of GridSearchCV.

4. [ML_assignment_4_House_Price.ipynb](ML_assignment_4_House_Price.ipynb) - Predicts house prices using RandomForest and RandomizedSearchCV.

## Dataset:

- The code utilizes the Insurance Fraud Dataset for training and testing.
- Some datasets are imported from Kaggle machine learning competitions.

## Libraries Used:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- plotly
- warnings

## Usage:

Feel free to explore each notebook for detailed implementations and explanations. The datasets used are available in the repository. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
