# Cell Phone Churn

Cell Phone Churn Project: Analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. 
Explore insights into factors influencing churn rates and predictive models implemented for informed decision-making

# Introduction
The "Cell Phone Churn" project focuses on addressing the challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications industry through advanced data analytics and 
machine learning. The objective is to analyze and predict customer churn using default settings for various classifiers and subsequently enhance the performance 
of the Random Forest classifier through hyperparameter tuning. This exploration aims to optimize predictive models and gain insights into the factors influencing 
churn rates.

# Objective 
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Implement default classification models to address the customer churn problem and establish baseline metrics.
2. Record key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, for each classifier on the test set.
3. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest classifier using random search to identify the best set of parameters.
4. Describe and construct a Random Forest classifier with the optimized parameters.
5. Compare the default results with the hyperparameter-tuned results for the Random Forest classifier to assess improvements in metrics.
6. Utilize the feature_importances_ property to identify and list the top 5 features influencing customer churn predictions.
7. Explore ensemble predictions through one-layer stacking, combining outputs from multiple classifiers, with KNN as the stacking classifier.
8. Add stacking results to the evaluation table and assess whether ensemble predictions yield improved performance compared to individual classifiers.
